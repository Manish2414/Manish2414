<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Cybersecurity Projects:</h2>

- <b>[Home Lab for Network Security (Firewall, Suricata, Kali Linux, Intrusion Detection System, Nmap)](https://github.com/Manish2414/Home-Lab-for-Network-Security-and-Intrusion-Detection)</b>
  - Constructed a dynamic virtualized network using VirtualBox, featuring OPNsense, Kali Linux for penetration testing, and Windows as the target system, showcasing proficiency in virtualization technologies.
  - Configured the deployment and configuration of OPNsense as the primary firewall solution, fortifying the network against potential threats. Implemented custom Nmap rules to detect and alert scanning activities intelligently.
  - Executed tests for intrusion detection (IDS) with Suricata, configured firewall rules, and performed vulnerability assessments. Enhanced cybersecurity measures through proactive detection, monitoring, and log analysis practices.
- <b>[Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and Honeypot (Virtualization, SIEM, Powershell)](https://github.com/Manish2414/Azure-Sentinel-SIEM)</b>
  - Proficiently configured an Azure Sentinel (Microsoft's cloud SIEM) workbook to visualize global attack data, specifically focusing on RDP brute force attacks, by mapping their physical locations and gauging attack magnitudes.
  - Streamlined data extraction from Windows Event Viewer with an efficient PowerShell script, integrated with a third-party API for geolocation, and represented the attacking counties in a world map.
- <b>[Virtual Network Design and Sniffing (Network Design, Network Protocol, Wireshark)](https://github.com/Manish2414/Virtual-Network-Design-and-Sniffing)</b>
  - Engineered the development of a detailed network design topology in VirtualBox, integrating RouterVM, PC1, and PC2; executed precise IP address assignments and routing strategies, emphasizing a robust network structure.
  - Implemented Wireshark on PC1 and TShark on RouterVM, both running Ubuntu Linux, for in-depth analysis and sniffing of network protocols within the intricacies of the designed network topology.
- <b>[Simple Caesar Encryptor (Python, Encryption, Caesar Cipher, Cryptography)](https://github.com/Manish2414/Simple-Caesar-Encryptor)</b>
  - Gained practical experience in encryption methods and cryptography fundamentals.
  - Achieved a firm grasp of the Caesar Cipher encryption technique, comprehending its application in cryptography.
- <b>[WifiPhish - a WiFi Phishing tool (HTML, PHP, Social Engineering, Phishing)](https://github.com/Manish2414/WifiPhish)</b>
  - Designed and developed a phishing tool, WifiPhish, using Linux, PHP, and HTML to conduct ethical phishing simulations.
  - Implemented social engineering techniques to capture WiFi passwords, measured by the tool's ability to retrieve user-entered credentials.
  - Utilized ngrok for seamless port forwarding, enabling remote access to the phishing website.
